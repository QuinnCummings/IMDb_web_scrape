# IMDb_web_scrape

I developed a script that scrapes the IMDb.com website for data on the Top 250 Movies as rated on IMDb.com. After collecting this data, I preformed Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) to model and summarize the collected data.

If the Python Notebook on github does not work, you can view my project here:
